Description:
==========
Written in 24 hours during HackJersey at Montclair State University which joined journalists, 
developers and data enthusiasts.

Our team goal was to try to analyze political data at the lowest level
possible, originally starting with zipcodes we were forced to lower our 
resolution to municipalities. Time constrants limited our ability to really
share a story with the analysis of the data but it presents much of the 
public available election data in a very structured way which would 
make the ability to link this data to more analysis in the future.

Technologies used:
==========
- web.py
- Postgres
- Twitter Bootstrap
- Google Maps API v3
- Google Fusion


This repo is messy. But what else can you expect from a hackathon! :D
